Provide a malware-scanner service over an HTTP interface. Files can be POSTed to the interface, which will respond with a true (file is clean) or false (file is infected).

This project is based on;

* [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/)

Open source virus scanner

* [clamav-java](https://github.com/solita/clamav-java/)

Open source project providing a streaming interface to the clamd daemon

* [clamav-rest](https://github.com/solita/clamav-rest)

Open source project providing a REST(ish) interface on top of clamav-java

* [UKHomeOffice/docker-clamav](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/docker-clamav)

Open source project by UK Home Office tying together all of the above

The Home Office project is designed to target a [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) cluster. This project is fundamentally the same, but with the source files organised slightly differently, and using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to tie the containers together.

# Usage

Using docker compose

    docker-compose up

    ./test/test.sh

To build and test the containers without docker compose

    ./build.sh
